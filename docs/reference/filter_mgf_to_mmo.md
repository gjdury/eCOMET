# Filter an MGF file to keep only spectra for features present in mmo\$feature_data\$id

Create a new `.mgf` file that contains only spectra (ION blocks) whose
`FEATURE_ID` occurs in `mmo$feature_data$id`. This is useful for keeping
your spectral library in sync with the features currently stored in an
`mmo` object (e.g., after subsetting, filtering, or rebuilding an
`mmo`).

## Usage

``` r
filter_mgf_to_mmo(
  mmo,
  mgf_path,
  output_path = NULL,
  chunk_lines = 100000L,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- mmo:

  An ecomet `mmo` object containing a required `feature_data` table with
  an `id` column (`mmo$feature_data$id`).

- mgf_path:

  Character. Path to the input `.mgf` file.

- output_path:

  Character or NULL. Path to write the filtered `.mgf`. If `NULL`
  (default), the output name is derived from `mgf_path` by appending
  `_filtered` before the `.mgf` extension (or adding `_filtered.mgf` if
  no extension is present).

- chunk_lines:

  Integer. Number of lines read per iteration. Larger values are
  typically faster but use more memory. Default is `100000L`.

- verbose:

  Logical. If `TRUE` (default), prints a short progress summary and
  final counts.

## Value

Invisibly returns a list with:

- `output_path`: path to the filtered MGF

- `blocks_total`: total `BEGIN IONS` blocks encountered

- `blocks_kept`: number of blocks written to `output_path`

- `lines_read`: total lines read from `mgf_path`

## Details

Each spectrum in an MGF is represented by a `BEGIN IONS ... END IONS`
block. This function keeps or discards entire blocks based on the
integer value in the `FEATURE_ID=` header line. All blocks (MS1 and MS2)
are kept for a retained feature, including multiple MS2 blocks if
present.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Write "<input>_filtered.mgf" containing only FEATURE_IDs present in mmo$feature_data$id
filter_mgf_to_mmo(mmo, "spectra.mgf")

# Write to a custom file name
filter_mgf_to_mmo(mmo, "spectra.mgf", output_path = "spectra_mmo_only.mgf")
} # }
```
