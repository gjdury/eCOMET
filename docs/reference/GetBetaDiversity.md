# GetBetaDiversity

Calculate beta diversity (sample-to-sample dissimilarity) for an mmo
object. Four methods are supported, differing in how they handle feature
abundance and structural relationships among compounds:

## Usage

``` r
GetBetaDiversity(
  mmo,
  method = "Gen.Uni",
  normalization = "None",
  distance = NULL,
  filter_id = FALSE,
  id_list = NULL,
  filter_group = FALSE,
  group_list = NULL,
  scale_dissim = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- mmo:

  The mmo object containing feature data and metadata

- method:

  Beta diversity method: 'Gen.Uni', 'bray', 'jaccard', or 'CSCS'
  (default: 'Gen.Uni')

- normalization:

  Abundance table to use. Options: 'None', 'Log', 'Meancentered', 'Z',
  'PA' (default: 'None'). Ignored for 'jaccard', which always uses PA.
  For 'bray' and 'CSCS', this is the primary lever for controlling
  abundance sensitivity.

- distance:

  Feature dissimilarity metric: 'dreams', 'm2ds', or 'cosine'. Required
  for 'Gen.Uni' and 'CSCS'; ignored for 'bray' and 'jaccard'.

- filter_id:

  A boolean indicating whether to filter the feature data by a specific
  list (default: FALSE)

- id_list:

  A list of feature names to filter the feature data by, if filter_id is
  TRUE (default: NULL)

- filter_group:

  A boolean indicating whether to filter the feature data by a specific
  group list (default: FALSE)

- group_list:

  A list of groups to filter the feature data by, if filter_group is
  TRUE (default: NULL)

- scale_dissim:

  Boolean; whether to scale the feature distance matrix to between 0,1
  (default: TRUE)

## Value

For 'bray', 'jaccard', 'CSCS': a symmetric sample-by-sample distance
matrix (matrix). For 'Gen.Uni': a named list with three distance
matrices named `d_0` (presence/absence), `d_0.5` (balanced), and `d_1`
(fully abundance-weighted).

## Details

- 'bray' : Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Feature-overlap only; no compound
  distance matrix required. Abundance sensitivity is controlled via
  `normalization`: use `'None'` for raw abundances, `'Log'` to compress
  dynamic range, or `'PA'` to reduce to presence/absence.

- 'jaccard' : Jaccard dissimilarity. Presence/absence only by
  definition. The `normalization` argument is ignored; PA data are
  always used internally. A warning is issued if a non-PA normalization
  is supplied.

- 'CSCS' : Chemical Structural and Compositional Similarity.
  Incorporates pairwise compound distances so that samples sharing
  structurally related (but not identical) features can still be
  considered similar. Requires `distance`. Abundance sensitivity is
  controlled via `normalization` (same options as bray).

- 'Gen.Uni' : Generalized UniFrac. Partitions beta diversity across
  branches of a compound dendrogram. Requires `distance`. Returns a
  named list of three distance matrices, one per abundance-weighting
  level (`d_0`, `d_0.5`, `d_1`). Choose the one appropriate for your
  analysis (see Details).

**Choosing an abundance-weighting level for Gen.Uni:**

- `d_0` – presence/absence only; equivalent to unweighted UniFrac. Use
  when detection (not intensity) is the signal of interest.

- `d_0.5` – balanced weighting. Moderates the influence of highly
  abundant features without ignoring abundance.

- `d_1` – fully abundance-weighted. Dominant features drive the
  distance. Use when peak intensity is a reliable biological signal.

Access a specific matrix with e.g. `result[["d_0.5"]]`.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) {
beta_diversity <- GetBetaDiversity(mmo, method = 'Gen.Uni',
 normalization = 'None', distance = 'dreams', filter_id = FALSE)
# Access a specific weighting level:
d_balanced <- beta_diversity[["d_0.5"]]
beta_diversity <- GetBetaDiversity(mmo, method = 'bray',
 normalization = 'Z', filter_id = TRUE, id_list = Glucosinolates,
 filter_group = TRUE, group_list = c('Control', 'Treatment1'))
}
```
