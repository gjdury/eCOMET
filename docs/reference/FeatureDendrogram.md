# FeatureDendrogram

Build a feature-to-feature dendrogram from a dissimilarity matrix stored
in the mmo object. Optionally collapses within-group distances for ion
identity or correlation groups so that adducts/isotopes of the same
compound cluster together before chemical distance drives the
higher-level topology.

## Usage

``` r
FeatureDendrogram(
  mmo,
  distance = "dreams",
  features = NULL,
  method = "average",
  ion_identity = c("none", "correlation", "ion_identity_network"),
  corr_col = "feature_group",
  iin_col = "ion_identities:iin_id",
  within_group_dist = 0.01,
  save_newick = FALSE,
  outprefix = "feature_tree"
)
```

## Arguments

- mmo:

  mmo object. Must contain the requested dissimilarity matrix (added via
  [`AddChemDist()`](https://phytoecia.github.io/eCOMET/reference/AddChemDist.md)
  or
  [`AddCustomDist()`](https://phytoecia.github.io/eCOMET/reference/AddCustomDist.md))
  and, for ion identity modes, `mmo$feature_info`.

- distance:

  Name of the dissimilarity matrix to use (default: `"dreams"`). Passed
  to
  [`GetDistanceMat()`](https://phytoecia.github.io/eCOMET/reference/GetDistanceMat.md);
  supports built-in and custom names.

- features:

  Optional character vector of feature IDs to include. `NULL` (default)
  uses all features in the distance matrix.

- method:

  hclust linkage method (default: `"average"`). Other sensible choices:
  `"complete"`, `"ward.D2"`.

- ion_identity:

  One of `"none"`, `"correlation"`, `"ion_identity_network"` (default:
  `"none"`).

- corr_col:

  Column in `mmo$feature_info` containing MZmine correlation group IDs
  (default: `"feature_group"`). Used when
  `ion_identity = "correlation"`.

- iin_col:

  Column in `mmo$feature_info` containing MZmine IIN IDs (default:
  `"ion_identities:iin_id"`). Used when
  `ion_identity = "ion_identity_network"`.

- within_group_dist:

  Distance assigned to pairs within the same ion identity group
  (default: `0.01`). A small positive value rather than 0 avoids
  degenerate zero-height clusters in the tree while still pulling
  grouped features together. Must be in `[0, 1]`.

- save_newick:

  Logical; if `TRUE` writes a Newick file (`<outprefix>.nwk`) of the
  tree (default: `FALSE`).

- outprefix:

  File prefix used when `save_newick = TRUE` (default:
  `"feature_tree"`).

## Value

A named list with:

- `hclust` – the `hclust` object

- `dendrogram` – the `dendrogram` object

- `phylo` – the `phylo` object (for ape/iTOL)

- `dist_used` – the (possibly modified) distance matrix used

- `tip_map` – data.frame of feature ID -\> group assignment (`NULL` when
  `ion_identity = "none"`)

## Details

**Ion identity options:**

- `"none"` – use the raw dissimilarity matrix as-is.

- `"correlation"` – features sharing the same MZmine correlation group
  (typically co-eluting features likely derived from the same compound)
  are assigned `within_group_dist` before clustering.

- `"ion_identity_network"` – features linked by MZmine ion identity
  networking (confirmed adducts / isotopes) are assigned
  `within_group_dist` before clustering.

In both grouped modes the constraint is applied symmetrically and the
diagonal is forced to 0 after the assignment.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) {
tree <- FeatureDendrogram(mmo, distance = "dreams")
tree_iin <- FeatureDendrogram(mmo, distance = "dreams",
                              ion_identity = "ion_identity_network")
}
```
