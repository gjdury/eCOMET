# PlotFoldchangeResistanceQuad

This function plots the fold change resistance in a quadrant plot,
categorizing points into quadrants based on their effect size and fold
change. It also performs a binomial test to assess the distribution of
points across quadrants.

## Usage

``` r
PlotFoldchangeResistanceQuad(
  performance_regression,
  fold_change,
  color,
  output_dir,
  save_output = TRUE,
  width = 6,
  height = 6
)
```

## Arguments

- performance_regression:

  The regression results data frame containing effect size, fold change,
  and tag. The output from GetPerformanceFeatureRegression,
  GetPerformanceFeatureLMM, or GetPerformanceFeatureCorrelation.

- fold_change:

  The name of the fold change column in the performance_regression
  dataframe

- color:

  A vector of colors for the points in the plot

- output_dir:

  The output file path for the quadrant plot

- save_output:

  A logical value indicating whether to save the output plot (default:
  TRUE)

- width:

  The width of the output plot in inches (default: 6)

- height:

  The height of the output plot in inches (default: 6)

## Value

A list containing the quadrant plot and the performance regression data
frame
