# GetFunctionalHillNumber

This function calculates the functional Hill number for a given mmo
object, normalization method, and distance metric. See
https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.18685 for
details of the functional Hill number calculation.

## Usage

``` r
GetFunctionalHillNumber(
  feature,
  metadata,
  distance_matrix,
  q = 1,
  threshold = 0,
  scale_dissim = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- feature:

  Feature table with columns: id, feature, then sample columns

- metadata:

  Metadata table with sample and group columns

- distance_matrix:

  Feature distance matrix

- q:

  The order of the Hill number to calculate (default: 1). Larger q
  values give more weight to evenness portion of the hill number over
  richness. q = 0 treats abundance matrix as a presence absence matrix

- threshold:

  Numeric; detection threshold for presence (default: 0)

- scale_dissim:

  Boolean; whether to scale the distance matrix to be between 0 and 1
  (default: TRUE)

## Value

A data frame containing the functional Hill number for each group in the
metadata, with columns for group and hill number.
