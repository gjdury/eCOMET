# Welcome to eCOMET: A Tool for Mass Spectrometry–Based Ecological Metabolomics

**eCOMET** is an R package designed specifically for ecological
metabolomics (ecometabolomics), in which researchers apply untargeted
mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to characterize the chemical
phenotypes of organisms in their ecological and evolutionary context.
Unlike metabolomics in biomedical or model-organism research,
ecometabolomics frequently involve non-model, non-animal systems where
genomic resources are scarce, reference spectral libraries provide
limited coverage, and metabolic pathway annotations remain incomplete.
Never the less, the goal of the package is to help chemical ecologists
gain ecological insights from metabolomics data despite these
contraints.

It has two core goals:

1.  **Standardize ecometabolomics workflows** by introducing the `mmo`
    object, a unified data container that keeps feature abundances,
    sample metadata, compound annotations, and chemical similarity
    matrices aligned throughout an analysis. eCOMET integrates directly
    with the outputs of leading metabolomics tools —
    [MZmine](https://mzmine.github.io/),
    [SIRIUS/CANOPUS](https://v6.docs.sirius-ms.io/),
    [DreaMS](https://dreams-docs.readthedocs.io/), and
    [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/) — making it easier to integrate data
    steams and improves reproducibility.

2.  **Provide educational resources for chemical ecologists** through
    annotated tutorials covering common study designs, from
    treatment-based experiments to multi-species field comparisons.
    Unlike biomedical metabolomics toolkits, eCOMET is built around the
    questions chemical ecologists actually ask: How does chemical
    diversity vary across species or habitats? Which compounds are
    differentially accumulated under stress? How does metabolomic
    composition relate to trait or performance data?

## Key Features

**Data ingestion and the `mmo` object** - Import MZmine feature tables
and link them to sample metadata - Add SIRIUS/CANOPUS compound class
annotations - Add pairwise chemical similarity from DreaMS,
MS2DeepScore, or cosine similarity - Add custom annotations from
in-house compound databases - Filter the `mmo` object by sample, group,
or feature list — all linked tables update together - Match and filter
associated MGF spectral files to keep MS2 data in sync

**Statistics and differential analysis** - Differential accumulation
analysis (DAMs) with pairwise group comparisons - Volcano plots, ANOVA
with post-hoc tests, and log2 fold-change summaries - Metabolite set
enrichment analysis (MSEA) using CANOPUS class annotations - Chemical
class enrichment analysis across multiple ClassyFire and NPC levels -
Phenotype association screening — correlate individual features with
continuous ecological variables (height, herbivory, temperature, etc.)

**Chemical diversity** - Alpha diversity: richness, Faith’s PD, Hill
numbers (q = 0, 1, 2), functional Hill numbers weighted by chemical
distance, rarefaction curves - Beta diversity: Bray-Curtis, Jaccard,
CSCS (Chemical Structural and Compositional Similarity), and Generalized
UniFrac using spectral similarity distances - Ordination: PCA, PLS-DA,
NMDS, PCoA, hierarchical clustering - Specialization index for comparing
chemical breadth across species or treatments

**Compound networks and dendrograms** - Build feature dendrograms from
pairwise chemical distances (DreaMS, MS2DeepScore, cosine, or custom) -
Incorporate Ion Identity Networking (IIN) and feature correlation
constraints into dendrogram topology - Visualize dendrograms with
`ggtree` — circular or rectangular layouts, class coloring, fully
layerable with ggplot2 - Export to iTOL for interactive annotation and
publication-quality circular trees - Export node and edge tables for
Cytoscape molecular network visualization

**Visualization** - All plot functions return `ggplot`/`ggtree` objects
— add layers, themes, and annotations after the call - Stacked bar plots
of NPC compound class composition by group - Heatmaps with flexible
normalization and annotation tracks

## Installation

Install eCOMET from GitHub using `pak` (recommended — handles all
dependencies automatically):

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("phytoecia/eCOMET")
library(ecomet)
```

Or using `remotes`:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("phytoecia/eCOMET")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting started

**New to eCOMET?** Start with the
[Introduction](https://phytoecia.github.io/eCOMET/articles/eCOMET-intro.md),
which explains the `mmo` object, required input file formats, and the
core preprocessing steps.

We currently support feature tables exported from **MZmine version 4 or
later**. See the [MZmine
documentation](https://mzmine.github.io/mzmine_documentation/module_docs/io/feat-list-export.html)
for export instructions.

## Tutorials

eCOMET includes worked case studies covering two common study designs in
chemical ecology:

1.  [Treatment-based
    study](https://phytoecia.github.io/eCOMET/articles/Tutorial_1_Treatment_based_study.md)
    — comparing chemical profiles between experimental treatments;
    covers normalization, DAM analysis, volcano plots, heatmaps, and
    enrichment analysis
2.  [Interspecific
    comparisons](https://phytoecia.github.io/eCOMET/articles/Tutorial_2_Interspecific_Comparisons.md)
    — comparing chemical diversity across co-occurring species; covers
    feature-based and structure-aware beta diversity, NMDS, PCoA, and
    hierarchical clustering
3.  [Compound dendrograms and molecular
    networks](https://phytoecia.github.io/eCOMET/articles/Tutorial_3_Dendrogram_and_Molecular_Networks.md)
    — building and exporting chemical similarity trees and networks for
    iTOL and Cytoscape
